# Chess

This is a command line version of the popular tabletop game chess.
Players take turns moving their pieces using the CLI with the goal of capturing the other player's king.
Once the king has been captured, the game is over and the player whose king remains is the victor.

README will be updated in the future with further instructions on how to run this app.
